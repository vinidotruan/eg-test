# Work Test
```
 The trial project is designed to take around 8 hours to complete. No need to rush or submit it exactly 8 hours after receiving this email—this is just the estimated time we expect you to spend on it. Feel free to fit it into your schedule in a way that works best for you.

Here’s what we’d like you to build for the trial:

- Create a health monitoring application using Laravel.
- It needs to provide data to the end-user in an useful manner.
- Develop a method for smart devices to send health data to the application over the internet. 
- Implement a feature that detects anomalies in the data by leveraging the OpenAI API.
- If you need to make decisions to simplify any aspects of the project due to time constraints, please document your reasoning.
- If you finish before the allocated time, feel free to add additional features or enhancements that you find interesting.

When you are finished, please provide not only the project itself but also a detailed description of your process, progress, and any challenges you encountered. Share how you approached the specifications, the difficulties you faced, and any other details that would help us better understand your work.
